Requirements for fastphylo:

* cmake
* wget

If you want to build the distributed version of fastprot, fastprot_mpi, you also need:

* openmpi (or equivalent), and set the CMAKE flag BUILD_WITH_MPI

Unfortunately, the MPI version does not build without tinkering on all platforms. It has worked for
us on Ubuntu/Debian using standard packages and on macOS using HomeBrew packages.

If you want to build the documentation (auto-generated examples, yielding up-to-date help-texts, it is a feature!),
then you also need:

* xmlto (only for -DBUILD_DOCROOT=ON)
* lxml, the Python library


This package uses the program cmake for building and packaging the software.
To install into the directory $HOME/inst run these commands:

  mkdir $HOME/inst
  cd fastphylo
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/inst ..

Without the installation prefix option, cmake installs into the
default path (may be /usr/local/bin).

If you want to build and install fastprot_mpi, remember to use the option
  -DBUILD_WITH_MPI=ON
in the cmake command.

If you want to install the documentation too, you need to add the flag
  -DBUILD_DOCBOOK=ON
to the cmake command line.
